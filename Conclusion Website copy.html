		WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?
<P align='center'>
Some of you guys might think, what does global warming have to do with animals? Here's a simple fact,  over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. The world is getting hotter and hotter each year. That means the north and south pole ice are melting! With melting ice, where would the animals live? They wouldnâ€™t have a place to live and they might die.

	WHAT CAUSES GLOBAL WARMING
<P align='center'>Global warming is caused by pollutions we created in factories and other companies. Gas from cars also cause the air to be really dirty and cause global warming. Also the amount trees being cut and burned causes smoke and soon, reach the atmosphere and trap the dirty warm air causing global warming. The cutting of the trees not only caused the global warming but makes many animals lose their home and die.

	WHAT WE CAN DO TO DECREASE GLOBAL WARMING
<P align='center'>
Using bike instead of cars would prevent a lot of carbon dioxide from going into the atmosphere. Planting trees could also be a good idea to stop global warming. Since tree store carbon dioxide that is in the air. We can also eat less meat because animals produce methane which is 20 times worse than carbon dioxide. Last, we can use alternative sources of energy. Such as solar wind or electric energy instead of burning fossil fuels.
